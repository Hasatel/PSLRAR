# PSLRAR: Prototype of Self-Learning Recursive Artificial Retardation  
**Date:** 2025-05-22  

## Concept Overview

**PSLRAR** is a conceptual attempt to build a recursively self-improving system that operates on the basis of dynamic, abstract memory links, capable of editing, optimizing, and refactoring its own functional codebase in response to environmental demands and internal evaluations.

This system is not a neural network in the classical sense, though it may borrow ideas from that field. It is an architecture focused on:

- **Abstract, self-expanding data structures**
- **Recursive self-editing and code transformation**
- **Heuristic association of information, including probabilistic memory links**
- **Simulation of cognitive-like prioritization, forgetting, and selective recall**

## Core Ideas

1. **Abstract Data and Parameters**  
   The system operates on arguments (e.g., A, B, etc.) that represent abstract functional units. These units contain multiple class definitions and parameter sets. Parameters are not fixed and must be dynamically extensible.

2. **Flexible Parameter Handling**  
   The core must be able to process variable numbers of parameters — meaning functions and their parameters should be encoded in a way that allows the model to interpret them in a scalable manner.

3. **Function Evaluation with Importance Weights**  
   Each function is associated with a vector of values (e.g., 0.0–1.0), which defines its perceived **utility**, **accuracy**, or **need for modification**. These weights affect whether a function is reused, edited, or discarded.

4. **Recursive Self-Improvement**  
   The model must not only learn how to reuse and optimize data/code but also **rewrite itself**, enhance existing logic, or discard unnecessary paths. Self-rewriting must be a core mechanic, guided by both statistical feedback and associative triggers.

5. **Contextual Retrieval via Associations**  
   Information must be stored in a way that allows **partial recall**. Think of memory as similar to how a human recalls smell: a few core cues (e.g., white table, a woman, rain) trigger memory, and the rest is filled in dynamically. These "keys" are not flat tags, but **active indicators** of context that imply the presence of additional linked data.

6. **Non-linear Memory Structures**  
   Classical key-value pair systems are too flat. The system must support **fuzzy, probabilistic, recursive associations**, akin to biological memory where retrieval is approximate and context-dependent.

7. **Code as Data**  
   Ultimately, the model operates not on real-world sensory data, but on **code fragments**. The core logic is that the system associates and manipulates code: understanding dependencies, generating function variations, and proposing improvements.

8. **Compilation and Execution**  
   At the output phase, the model assembles code blocks into a complete, functional script. Ideally, it can **compile and test** its own results — optionally simulating their execution or running them in sandboxed environments for feedback.

## Compiler Block – The Adaptive Translator

   The Compiler Block is not a static code generator, but rather an adaptive translator that evolves with the model. Its main function is to transform internal abstract representations (whether they are floating-point vectors, symbolic structures, or even chaotic ASCII streams) into executable code or interpretable structures.

Key characteristics:
   * Self-mutable: The model can modify or even completely rewrite this block based on observed patterns or failures.
   * Format-agnostic: No assumptions are made about input formats. The model may arrive at entirely new internal languages or structures.
   * Dynamic encoding: It acts like a language decoder, translating abstract intent into working code, but the language itself can change.
   * Error tolerance and evolution: Even the error-checking logic can be adjusted by the model — e.g., favoring different types of strictness or tolerating anomalies to learn from them.
   * Data and memory structures should allow for deletion, decay, or overwriting...

## Naming Rationale

- **Prototype** – This is a conceptual framework, not yet a fully working engine.
- **Self-Learning** – The system is designed to evolve its behavior without external rule-based supervision.
- **Recursive** – Both memory and logic must be recursive in nature, where changes loop back to influence the system’s own behavior.
- **Artificial Retardation** – A darkly humorous nod to the system’s likely inefficient, naive beginnings and its open-ended, chaotic development path.

## Near-Term Goals

- Create a basic simulation of recursive memory with weight-based evaluation
- Define and test a dynamic association system for code chunks
- Begin developing rule-based logic for function scoring and mutation
- Log all major concept updates in `idea_<date>.md` files
